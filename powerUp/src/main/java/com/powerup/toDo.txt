Existing ideas:

- Build in-game help system
- Implement menu bar with "New game" and "Help" options; move "New game" away
  from "Commands" panel
- Add possibility of playing two- or three-player game
- Add option to include Department of Energy as passive player - necessary for
  two-player game to be interesting
- Create dice roll graphics for rolling actions
- Put information panel updates on timer, particularly at the end of the game
