      <h1>Tips</h1>
      <p>If you're struggling with the game, the following advice might be
         useful to you.</p>

      <p><strong>Create a new company whenever possible.</strong> The free share
         you receive is often enough to give you a minority bonus, or even a 
         majority bonus, if the company is sold quickly.</p>

      <p><strong>Think carefully about which company to create.</strong> If you
         are low on cash, create one of the cheaper companies (Eclipse Solar and
         Maniac Timber) so that you can buy more shares in them and have a
         greater chance of acquiring a majority or minority bonus. On the other
         hand, if you have more cash than other players, pick one of the more
         expensive companies (Superslick Oil and Whoops Uranium) and grow them
         quickly to put their shares out of reach of other players.</p>

      <p><strong>Don't buy more shares than is necessary.</strong> The biggest
         opportunity for making money in the game is through mergers, so once
         you hold enough shares in a company to be either the majority or
         minority shareholder, there is little point in buying more. 13 shares
         is always enough to be the majority shareholder, but in games with more
         than two players or games with the DoE active, a significantly lower
         number is usually enough.</p>

      <p><strong>Don't put all your faith in one company.</strong> If other
         players notice that you have bought up nearly all the shares in any
         company, it will be in their interests to make sure that company does
         not grow and is not taken over by any other company. They may hold
         tiles which would be very lucrative for you, but will have no incentive
         to play them.</p>

      <p><strong>Change your strategy as the game progresses.</strong>
         Initially, you will want to buy shares in companies that look like they
         will be taken over soon. Later in the game, if it becomes clear that
         one company is going to dominate the board, you may wish to buy shares
         in that company instead, as they will quickly grow in value.</p>
