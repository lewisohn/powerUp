      <h2>Version history</h2>

      <h3>1.0, released 2014-02-28</h3>
      <p>Initial release of the game.</p>

      <h2>Development</h2>
      <p>This game was developed in a month and a half for a software course at
         the Computer Science department of the University of Helsinki. It was
         written in Java, using the Swing library for its graphical
         interface.</p>
      <p>The idea for this game came from an 1993 Mac OS game called Power
         Players, developed by Greg Francis, which in turn was based on the 1962
         board game Acquire, designed by Sid Sackson. No copyright is claimed
         and no infringement is intended.</p>

         Vapaakallio for their assistance in the testing and development of this
         game.</p>
