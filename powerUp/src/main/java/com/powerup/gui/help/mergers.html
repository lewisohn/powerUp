      <h1>Mergers</h1>

      <p>Mergers - also known as takeovers - are a crucial part of the game,
         so much so that being able to initiate the right mergers can be the
         difference between first and last place.</p>

      <h2>Initiating a merger</h2>
      <p>As described in the "Playing a turn" tab, a merger is initiated when
         a tile is played that is adjacent to at least two different
         companies' tiles.</p>
      <p>If there are exactly two companies with tiles adjacent to the newly
         played tile, the larger company will take over the smaller one. If
         there are more than two companies, the largest company will first
         take over the second largest, then the next largest, all the way
         down to the smallest.
      <p>If two or more companies are the same size when a merger is
         initiated, the active player may choose which company will survive.
         If a company tries to take over two or more (smaller) companies
         which are the same size as one another, the player may choose which
         one will be taken over first.</p>

      <h2>Effects of a merger</h2>
      <p>For each company that merges into the surviving company, bonuses are
         awarded, shares are sold, and company is liquidated. Each of these
         stages is detailed further below. Note that in this section, the DoE,
         if enabled for the game, is considered a player.</p>

      <h3>Awarding of majority and minority bonuses</h3>
      <p>Whichever player holds the most shares in the selling company receives
         a majority bonus of ten times the value of one share at the time of
         sale, and whichever player (if any) holds the second most shares in the
         selling company receives a minority bonus of five times the value of
         one share at the time of sale.</p>
      <p>In the event that only one player owns shares in the selling company,
         they receive the combined minority and minority bonuses.</p>
      <p>In the event that two or more players are tied for the highest number
         of shares in the selling company, they each receive an equal share of
         the combined majority and minority bonuses. No other bonuses are
         awarded.</p>
      <p>In the event that one player is a clear majority shareholder but two or
         more players are tied for being the minority shareholder, the tied
         players each receive an equal share of the minority bonus, and the
         majority shareholder receives the usual majority bonus.</p>
      <p>Here are two examples to help illustrate this process more clearly.</p>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><table>
            <tr><td><strong>Selling company</strong></td><td><strong>Maniac Timber</strong></td></tr>
            <tr><td>Share price</td><td>$200</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Player 1's ownership</td><td> 5 shares</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Player 2's ownership</td><td>3 shares</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Player 3's ownership</td><td>3 shares</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Player 4's ownership</td><td>1 share</td></tr>
         </table></div>
      <p>In the above example, Player 1 receives a bonus of (10 * $200) = $2000
         as the majority shareholder, while Players 2 and 3 receive a bonus of
         ((1/2) * 5 * $200) = $500 each as joint minority shareholders.</p>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><table>
            <tr><td><strong>Selling company</strong></td><td><strong>Superslick Oil</strong></td></tr>
            <tr><td>Share price</td><td>$400</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Player 1's ownership</td><td> 5 shares</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Player 2's ownership</td><td>7 shares</td></tr>
            <tr><td>The DoE's ownership</td><td>7 shares</td></tr>
         </table></div>
      <p>In the above example, Player 2 and the DoE are joint majority
         shareholders, so they each receive a bonus of ((1/2) * (10 + 5) * $400)
         = $3000. Player 1 does not receive a bonus.</p>

      <h3>Sale of shares</h3>
      <p>After the bonuses have been awarded, each player sells the shares they
         hold in the selling company. They receive the value of the shares at
         the time of sale.</p>

      <h3>Liquidation of selling company</h3>
      <p>After each player has sold their shares in the selling company, all of
         its tiles are transferred to the purchasing company, and the selling
         company is liquidated. This means they are no longer active, and may be
         re-created elsewhere on the board on a subsequent turn in the usual
         fashion (see the "Playing a turn" tab for information on creating
         companies).</p>
