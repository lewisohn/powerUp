      <h1>Overview</h1>

      <p>powerUp is a game in which you and up to three other players compete
         to amass the most cash as you control the future of six energy
         companies.</p>

      <h2>Getting started</h2>
      <p>Choose how many players you would like in your game, from two to
         four. You may give each player a name or stick with the
         defaults.</p>
      <p>You may also choose whether or not to play with the Department of
         Energy (DoE for short). The DoE is a passive player that buys shares
         when a new company is created and earns bonuses when they are
         merged, but does not compete for victory. Playing with the DoE is
         recommended for two-player games, but can be selected for any size
         of game.</p>
      <p>Note that the use of the word "player" in these help pages does not
         refer to the DoE unless otherwise stated.</p>

      <h2>Initial draw</h2>
      <p>At the very beginning of the game, each player is randomly allocated
         one tile. These tiles determine the order of play: whichever
         player's tile is closest to the left side of the board goes first,
         and the remaining players follow in order from left to right. In
         case of a tie, the player whose tile is closer to the top of the
         board goes first.</p>
      <p>Each player then takes their turns in order, starting with a cash
         balance of $6000. More information on playing a turn is available in
         the next tab, "Playing a turn".</p>
