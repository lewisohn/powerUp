        <h1>Playing a turn</h1>

        <p>At the beginning of each turn, you will receive a random number of
            actions for that turn. There is a 3/6 chance you will get three actions,
            a 2/6 chance you will get four actions, and a 1/6 chance you will get
            two actions. Actions do not carry over to the next turn.</p>
        <p>You may use your actions for many purposes, each of which is detailed
            below. Your first action must be either to draw tiles or play a
            tile.</p>

        <h2>Drawing tiles</h2>
        <p>Whenever you have less than five tiles in your hand, you may press the
            "Draw tiles" button to receive up to five new ones. You may never hold
            more than five tiles in your hand at any time.</p>

        <h2>Playing a tile</h2>
        <p>You may play a tile with your first action, or, if you chose to draw
            new tiles with your first action, you <em>must</em> play a tile with your
            second action.</p> 
        <p>When you hover over a tile, its location on the board will be
            highlighted. Clicking the tile plays it to that location.</p>
        <p>If the tile you played has no neighbouring tiles on the board (in the
            four compass directions - diagonal neighbours are not counted), then
            it becomes a neutral tile, and nothing happens. You may use your
            remaining actions, if you have any, to play more tiles, to buy
            shares or to draw new tiles.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if the tile you played has at least one
            neighbouring tile, then one of three things - an attempt to create a
            new company, an expansion of an existing company, and a merger of
            two or more companies - will take place. These three events are
            detailed below. After one of them has occurred, you will no longer
            be able to play tiles on your current turn (unless the tile you
            played caused a failed attempt to create a new company), but you may
            use your remaining actions, if you have any, to buy shares or to
            draw new tiles.</p>

        <h3>Creating a new company</h3>
        <p>After playing a tile, if it has at least one neighbouring neutral
            tile and no neighbour tiles belonging to a company, then an attempt
            to create a new company will be made. This attempt will succeed if
            there are fewer than six active companies on the board at the time,
            and fail otherwise.</p>
        <p>You may select any company to create from the list of currently
            inactive companies, and you will receive one free share in that
            company. If the DoE is in the game (see the "Overview" tab for more
            information on the DoE), it will receive a random number of shares
            in the company, at least one and no more than 10 minus the number of
            players in the game (e.g. in a two-player game, no more than eight).
        </p>
        <p>Each company has a pre-determined starting share price.
            These prices are as follows:</p>
        <div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:12px;"><table>
                <tr><td>Eclipse Solar</td><td>$200</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Maniac Timber</td><td>$200</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Cortex Power</td><td>$300</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Rufus Geothermal</td><td>$300</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Superslick Oil</td><td>$400</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Whoops Uranium</td><td>$400</td></tr>
            </table></div>
        <p>After a company has been created, it will build its headquarters at
            the tile you played, and expand into any neighbouring neutral tiles.
        </p>

        <h3>Expanding a company</h3>
        <p>If the tile you played has at least one neighbour tile belonging to
            a company, but does not have neighbouring tiles belonging to two
            <em>different</em> companies, then the neighbouring company will
            expand into the tile you played, as well as any neighbouring neutral
            tiles.</p>
        <p>When a company expands, its share prices increases by $50 for each
            new tile it acquires. For example, the starting share price for
            Eclipse Solar is $200, and once it has expanded into two additional
            tiles, giving it a total size of four tiles, its share price will be
            $200 + (2 * $50) = $300.</p>

        <h3>Merging two or more companies</h3>
        <p>If the tile you played has neighbouring tiles belonging to two
            or more different companies, a merger will be initiated. Mergers
            are one of the most important elements of the game, and you can read
            more about them on the "Mergers" tab.</p>

        <h2>Buying shares</h2>
        <p>Once you have played at least one tile to the board, you may use your
            remaining actions to buy shares in the currently active companies by
            clicking the "Stock market" button and bringing up the shares
            dialog.</p>
        <p>Each company starts with 25 shares when it is created, and no
            additional shares are issued when they have sold out. You cannot buy
            shares in inactive companies.</p>
        <p>You may only buy a share from a company if you have enough cash to do
            so, and if you have actions remaining. Each purchase counts as one
            action, so you need three actions to buy three shares, for example.
        <p>There are two reasons to buy shares. Firstly, if you buy shares in a
            small company which then expands, your shares will be worth more
            than when you bought them. Secondly, and more importantly, if you
            buy enough shares to become either the largest or second largest
            owner of shares in any given company, you will receive a sizeable
            bonus if and when the company is taken over by another. You can read
            more about those bonuses on the "Mergers" tab.</p>

        <h2>Ending your turn</h2>
        <p>Once you have run out actions, you may not draw new tiles, play any
            more tiles or buy any more shares, but you can still view the stock
            market. Once you are ready to continue with the game, press the "End
            turn" button to pass the turn to the next player.</p>
