      <h1>End of the game</h1>
      <p>There are three ways in which the game can end: a company reaching
         size 50, two companies reaching size 30, and any player running out of
         tiles when there are no more remaining to be drawn.</p>

      <h2>Procedure</h2>
      <p>Every active company at the end of the game is sold and liquidated,
         exactly as if it were the subject of a takeover during the game. More
         information on the precise procedure is available on the "Mergers" tab.
      </p>

      <h2>Rankings</h2>
      <p>After the game has ended, each player will hold only cash, and no
         shares. Whichever player has the most cash is the winner, and every
         other player is ranked in descending order of wealth.</p>
